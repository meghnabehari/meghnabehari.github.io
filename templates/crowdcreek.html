                        <h1 class="display-3">part 1: fracking impact on waterways</h1>
                        <p>Growing up in western Pennsylvania, I lived amongst the Marcellus Shale, the sedimentary formation which stands as the largest onshore Natural Gas Reserve in the United States. In fact, nearly 1.2 million Pennsylvanians live within half a mile of an oil or gas drilling well. 
                        Fracking's impact on the environment is an ongoing scientific question. I aimed to conduct my own research on the water and sediment quality of two local waterways in Western Pennsylvania, which are in close proximity to drilling and wastewater treatment facilities. </p>
                        
                        <p>In the study, I compared upstream and downstream water and sediment samples based on pH, conductivity, and chemicals, to see if there were significant differences. I collected both water and
                        sediment samples from various upstream and downstream locations, relative to the wastewater discharge.
                        Analysis of pH and electrical conductivity were performed at the site. Both sediment and water samples
                        were then sent in to be tested. After analysis of both water and sediment samples, it was clear that
                        upstream locations from potential sources of contamination contained significantly less contaminants
                        linked to fracking such as Bromide and Radium than downstream locations.</p>

                        <p>Site visits and testing methods were done alongside a local water-quality inspector. Water-quality inspectors are hired by the state to monitor and report on water and sediment conditions in the state.</p>

                        <h1 class="display-3">part 2 (ongoing) : crowd-sourced citizen scientist data</h1>
                        <p>From the research project conducted above, I had come into contact with an already-existing network of water quality inspectors with copious water health data of the region. On the other hand, the average citizen in my region had little awareness of the health of their water. </p>
                        <p>Thus, In 2021, I embarked on a venture to create a community of citizens and scientists to improve water
                            testing within regions, as well as educate others on the water quality crisis as well as the importance of
                            testing. I started creating Crowd Creek, a website and network which aims to ignite a community-wide
                            response in order to attain clean drinking water and raise awareness on the prevalence of water
                            contamination in communities all across the country. On Crowd Creek, students, citizens, and scientists
                            can learn more about contaminants, potential sources of contamination, and how to test water in their own
                            region. This platform is intended to be used in conjuction with <em>Aquabot </em> (read more about it <a href ="aquabot.html" target="_blank"> here</a>)
