						<p>Inspired by my work with local water quality inspectors (read <a style="letter-spacing: 0; color:white; text-decoration:underline;"href=crowdcreek.html> here</a>) and concerned about increasing global water scarcity, I built from scratch a robotic platform intended to simplify the water testing process. Aquabot wirelessly tests for various water quality parameters, including pH, TDS, conductivity, and others, and logs the measurement of each parameter along with time, data, and location of collection.</p>
						<p>Aquabot has two interfaces. The simplest is the LED interface, which blinks red if
							the parameter in the water is is too high, yellow if it is too low, and green if it is healthy. These thresholds are based off of EPAâ€™s
							guidelines for fresh surface water. I also created an Android smartphone app interface, which receives data from Aquabot through Bluetooth, and allows the user to
							read the data being collected in real time. All data is saved under the date it was collected, and can be
							accessed at any time.</p>
						<p>To test the real-life
							application of Aquabot, I visited six water quality inspectors and I asked them to fill out a survey. They
							gave me feedback on how they could use my tool in their work, and I was able to get a better idea of the
							need for my platform. Based off of the comments I received from the water quality inspectors, Aquabot
							would be an extremely handy tool in their work.</p>
						I applied for and was granted a full patent for the platform, which can be read in full below.
